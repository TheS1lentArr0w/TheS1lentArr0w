The MERN Full Stack from [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). This includes:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB

This is my first exposure to the full stack. The course is also developing my Git and GitHub proficiency as the exercises are submitted through repositories ([my submissions](https://github.com/TheS1lentArr0w/full_stack_open)).

I have also embarked on [The Complete 2021 PHP Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-php-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/15716836?start=0#overview). This is to give me insight on the full stack from a PHP side.
